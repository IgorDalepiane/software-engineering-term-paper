First and foremost, I would like to thank my family Eliane, Jair and Mateus, who always helped me in all my obstacles and above all taught me the values, love and religiosity that I carry with me to this day. I also thank all the family members who gave me strength and support to keep me on the road.

A special thanks to my advisor Maicon Bernardino who has always been there to teach and guide me through this journey.

I also thank my colleague Lucas Fell who has been with me since the beginning of college, helping to overcome the challenges along the way.

Thank you for everything and God bless you all!
